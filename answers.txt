Answer: Data science is making a real difference in cancer research,
helping scientists sift through huge amounts of medical and biological 
data to spot trends, make predictions, and even discover new treatment options.
For example, machine learning is being used to predict how patients might 
respond to treatments like chemotherapy or immunotherapy, helping doctors make more 
informed decisions.

Q3: What is the difference between merging and rebasing?

Answer: Merging takes the changes from one branch and combines 
them into another branch. Rebasing moves the commits from one branch on top of another. 
Instead of merging the branches, it rewrites the history by 
applying the commits from the feature branch onto the tip of the main branch.

Q4: What skills do you hope to improve during this course?

Answer: I hope to gain hands on experience with big data that I can apply in real life scenarios and job interviews! 
I hope to improve my python skills, groupwork skills, and time management skills aswell.
